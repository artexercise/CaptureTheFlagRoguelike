# CaptureTheFlagRoguelike

Starting with a Javascript Unicode Map.  I hope to create a Roguelike that will play a game of capture the flag in an urban environment where the player must solve some riddles/problems in order to help protect their own flag and discover their opponents flag and seize the flag to win the day.

I've never done a roguelike before.  Wish me luck.
